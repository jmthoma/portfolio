		<h1>My Costa Rica Trip - Coming Soon!</h1>

		<p> Last week I got back from my trip to Costa Rica with my best friends. It is one of the most beautiful countries I have ever visited! The people are so kind and generous, and the landscape is so beautiful. I still can't believe everything we did while there! We backpacked through the forest, relaxed in hot springs, learnt how coffee was made, and watched a group of sea turtles hatch. I can't wait to visit again!<p>

			<p> This adorable sloth was hanging on one of the trees at a conservatory we went to. We searched all day to try and find on in the trees.<p>
			<img src = "images/costa-volcano.jpg" alt = 'Volcano & Nature' width="200"/>
			<p> This is one of the volcanoes we saw while hiking. Did you know there are over 200 volcanoes in Costa Rica? But, only 6 of them are considered to be active.<p>

		<p> Stay tuned! I will post more pictures later this week and details to our trip. </p>
