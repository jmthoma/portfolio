		<h1>My Costa Rica Trip - Coming Soon!</h1>

		<p> Last week I got back from my trip to Costa Rica with my best friends. It is one of the most beautiful countries I have ever visited! The people are so kind and generous, and the landscape is so beautiful. I still can't believe everything we did while there! We backpacked through the forest, relaxed in hot springs, learnt how coffee was made, and watched a group of sea turtles hatch. I can't wait to visit again!<p>

			<p> This adorable sloth was hanging on one of the trees at a conservatory we went to. We searched all day to try and find on in the trees. There are many sloth sanctuary's located throughout Costa Rica, but they can still be really hard to find! I recommend going on a Sloth tour with a Guide who can help you try to find them.<p>

			<p> This is one of the volcanoes we saw while hiking. "One of your first thoughts upon imagining Costa Rica should be volcanoes. The country contains over 60 which are considered extinct or dormant plus six which are still active. There is an array of activities all centered around their impressive and imposing heights. The heat from magma that has risen close to the surface has resulted in hot springs whose mineral water is a draw for spa enthusiasts. "<p>

		<p> Stay tuned! I will post more pictures later this week and details to our trip. </p>
