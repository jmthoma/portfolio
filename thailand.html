	<main>
		<p> I have been dreaming of visiting Thailand FOR EVER! And, I have finally made plans to go Summer 2024, with my siblings. Even though its 2 years away I have already started planning our travel itinerary. Below are some of the places and food we HAVE to visit/try while there.<p>

				<p>I love elephants! They are my spirit animal, and in Thailand they have an Elephant Conservatory.<p>
			<img src = "images/thailand-fish.jpg" alt = 'Thai Fish Dish' width="200"/>
				<p>Thai food is my favorite cuisine, I can't wait to try all of the authentic dishes. Including fresh fish.<p>
			<img src = "images/thailand-fruit.jpg" alt = 'Lady with Boat Full of Tropical Fruits' width="200"/>
				<p>Tropical fruits, like mangoes & banana are my go-to breakfast food.<p>
			<img src = "images/thailand-park.jpg" alt = 'Doi Inthanon National Park' width="200"/>
				<p>Doi Inthanon National Park is a beautiful park in Chiang Mai.<p>
			<img src = "images/thailand-sunset.jpg" alt = 'Sunset at Beach' width="200"/>
				<p>I heard Thailand has beautiful beaches, perfect for watching the sunset.<p>

				<p>A beautiful temple in Thailand.<p>
